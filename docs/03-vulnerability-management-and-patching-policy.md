## 1. Purpose

This policy defines how vulnerabilities are identified, assessed, and remediated across the CR Hood Solutions Business Manager platform. It establishes scanning requirements, patching service level agreements (SLAs), and end-of-life software monitoring procedures.

## 2. Scope

This policy covers:

- Application dependencies (npm packages) across the backend API and all seven frontend applications
- The Node.js runtime environment
- The PostgreSQL database engine
- Production infrastructure managed by third-party providers (Railway, Vercel)
- Developer workstations used to develop and deploy the platform

## 3. Shared Responsibility Model

The platform operates on managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers. Vulnerability management responsibilities are divided as follows:

### Provider Responsibility (Railway, Vercel)

- Operating system patching and updates on production hosts
- Container runtime security
- Network infrastructure security
- TLS certificate management
- Physical and environmental security of hosting infrastructure

### CR Hood Solutions Responsibility

- Application-level dependency management (npm packages)
- Node.js runtime version selection and updates
- PostgreSQL major version upgrades
- Application code security
- Developer workstation security
- Configuration and secrets management

## 4. Vulnerability Scanning

### Automated Dependency Scanning

The platform uses automated vulnerability scanning through GitHub Actions to detect known vulnerabilities in application dependencies:

- **Scheduled scans** run weekly (Monday at 8:00 AM UTC) against the backend and all frontend applications
- **Event-triggered scans** run on every push to the main branch when package.json or package-lock.json files are modified
- **Manual scans** may be triggered at any time through the GitHub Actions interface
- Scan results are retained as artifacts for 90 days to provide compliance evidence
- When high or critical vulnerabilities are detected during scheduled scans, a GitHub issue is automatically created to track remediation

### Scan Coverage

| Component                 | Scan Method                  | Frequency        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Backend (Node.js/Express) | npm audit via GitHub Actions | Weekly + on push |
| Back Office (React)       | npm audit via GitHub Actions | Weekly + on push |
| Herds & Flocks (React)    | npm audit via GitHub Actions | Weekly + on push |
| Restaurant POS (React)    | npm audit via GitHub Actions | Weekly + on push |
| POS Terminal (React)      | npm audit via GitHub Actions | Weekly + on push |
| Kitchen Display (React)   | npm audit via GitHub Actions | Weekly + on push |
| Onboarding Portal (React) | npm audit via GitHub Actions | Weekly + on push |
| Ecommerce Site (React)    | npm audit via GitHub Actions | Weekly + on push |

### Developer Workstation Security

Developer workstations are maintained with:

- Operating system automatic updates enabled (Windows Update)
- Endpoint protection active (Windows Defender or equivalent)
- Current versions of development tools (Node.js, Git, IDE)

## 5. Patching Service Level Agreements

When vulnerabilities are identified, they are classified by severity and remediated within the following timeframes:

| Severity           | CVSS Score  | Response SLA                          | Examples                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | 9.0 – 10.0 | 72 hours                              | Remote code execution, authentication bypass          |
| **High**     | 7.0 – 8.9  | 14 days                               | Privilege escalation, significant data exposure       |
| **Medium**   | 4.0 – 6.9  | 30 days                               | Cross-site scripting, moderate information disclosure |
| **Low**      | 0.1 – 3.9  | 90 days or next scheduled maintenance | Minor information disclosure, theoretical attacks     |

### SLA Measurement

- The SLA clock starts when the vulnerability is reported by the automated scan or otherwise discovered
- The SLA is met when the patched version is deployed to production
- If a patch is not available from the upstream maintainer, the SLA clock is paused and a compensating control or workaround is evaluated

### Deployment Process

Patches are deployed through the standard deployment pipeline:

1. Update the affected dependency in package.json / package-lock.json
2. Run local tests to verify no regressions
3. Commit and push to the main branch
4. Railway automatically deploys the backend; Vercel automatically deploys the frontend
5. Verify the deployment in production

This process typically completes within minutes of the commit, meaning the actual deployment window is short once the fix is applied.

## 6. End-of-Life Software Monitoring

### Tracked Components

The following components are actively monitored for end-of-life status:

| Component              | EOL Source                                     | Review Frequency              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Node.js                | https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases  | Semi-annually (January, July) |
| PostgreSQL             | https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/ | Semi-annually (January, July) |
| Express.js             | GitHub repository / npm                        | Annually                      |
| React                  | GitHub repository / npm                        | Annually                      |
| Major npm dependencies | npm audit advisories                           | Ongoing via automated scans   |

### EOL Response

- Components approaching EOL (within 6 months) are flagged for upgrade planning
- Components that have reached EOL must be upgraded within 90 days
- If an EOL component cannot be upgraded within 90 days, a risk assessment is documented and compensating controls are identified

### Current Component Inventory

This inventory is updated at each semi-annual review:

| Component  | Current Version | EOL Date                  | Status  |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Node.js    | *18.20.8*     | 30 April 2027             | Current |
| PostgreSQL | 17.7            | 13 November 2029          | Current |
| Express.js | 4.18.2          | N/A (actively maintained) | Current |
| React      | 18.2.0          | N/A (actively maintained) | Current |

*Note: This table should be populated with actual version numbers during each review cycle.*

## 7. Exception Process

If a vulnerability cannot be remediated within the defined SLA, the following process applies:

1. Document the vulnerability, its severity, and the reason the SLA cannot be met
2. Identify and implement compensating controls where possible (e.g., WAF rules, input validation, feature disablement)
3. Obtain approval from the Platform Owner for the exception
4. Set a revised remediation date
5. Review the exception at each subsequent review cycle until resolved

## 8. Recordkeeping

The following records are maintained as evidence of vulnerability management activities:

- GitHub Actions scan artifacts (retained 90 days per run, continuously regenerated)
- GitHub issues created for vulnerability findings
- Git commit history showing dependency updates and patches
- This policy document with review dates
- Component inventory updates from semi-annual reviews

## 9. Policy Review

This policy is reviewed annually or when significant changes occur to the platform's technology stack, hosting providers, or threat landscape. The component inventory section is updated semi-annually.
